# Homework 2

* Due: 4/28 -- late homework not accepted
* Up to two students may collaborate; please be prepared to discuss individual contributions

## Overview

For this assignment your team will perform two tasks:

1. You will implement a Java version of any of the three sorting algorithm we've discussed in class.  Note that insertion sort has been done, so don't do that one.  You will modify `Deck` such that there is a method `Sort()` where your cards are sorted.  You can, again assume `D > H > C > S` for those cards within a rank.  

2. You will compare two sorting performances.  For this you can either 
   - Compare your sorting algorithm against another sorting algorithm or 
   - If you implement quicksort then you can compare this against the Java built-in quicksort implementation
